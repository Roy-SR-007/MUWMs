# MUWMs
This is a repository created in view of documenting and storing the codes related to the research on Mutually Unbiased Weighing Matrices.

* The first code file named `MUWMs.R` corresponds to a `R-Script`, which focusses on the generation of MUWMs of dimension d = (q-a).q, where q is a prime, and a is nonzero. We have coded for the particular case, d = (3-1).3 = 6, i.e., q = 3 and a = 1. We need to generalize it further for other primes q.
